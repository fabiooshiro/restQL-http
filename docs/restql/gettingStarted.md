# Getting Started

## Running restQL-http

restQL-http allows you to run ad-hoc queries and to reference resources pre-configured in the server startup.

1. Download the latest release in the [release page](https://github.com/B2W-BIT/restQL-http/releases),
2. Unzip the package,
3. Run `planets=https://swapi.co/api/planets/:id ./bin/run.sh`.

**Note:** In this case, we added the `planets` resource as a variable to the `run.sh` command. Besides that, resources can also be added via **mongoDB** or **configuration file**, for more information, please read the [configuration page](/restql/config.md).

Post to http://your-server.ip:9000/run-query the body below and content-type text/plain:

```bash
curl -d "from planets as allPlanets" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" localhost:9000/run-query 
```

## Your first query

Here's a basic example of what a restQL query should look like:

```
from planets
    with id = 1
```
**Note:** on this example, we use [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co) for educational purposes. The `planets` resource leads to `https://swapi.co/api/planets/:id`

from which you get the response:
```json

  "planets": {

      "success": true,
